This repository showcases a collection of Data Analysis and Machine Learning projects I have worked on. Please note that some projects are still in progress and may be updated over time.

## Highlighted Projects

### Email Spam Detector

The **Email Spam Detector** project is a machine learning model designed to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam. This project employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze email content and determine its likelihood of being spam.

#### Features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparation of email datasets for training and testing.
- **NLP Techniques**: Utilization of tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to process email text.
- **Model Training**: Application of machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes for classification tasks.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive testing and evaluation to ensure high accuracy and precision in spam detection.

This project serves as a practical application of machine learning and NLP in addressing real-world challenges, demonstrating the potential of these technologies in enhancing email security and user experience.
